# COP-4530
COP 4530 – Data Structures & Algorithms (C++)

This repository contains my programming assignments for COP 4530: Data Structures & Algorithms, implemented in C++.
Each project focuses on building core data structures from scratch, emphasizing generic programming, iterators, recursion, and STL-style interfaces.

These projects demonstrate proficiency in object-oriented design, templates, memory management, and algorithmic problem solving.

📌 Project 1: Template Vector Class and Iterator

Educational Objectives

Practice implementing a templated container class

Understand the fundamentals of iterators and generic traversal

Gain experience with dynamic memory management and operator overloading

Description
Implemented a custom templated vector class that mimics core functionality of std::vector, along with an associated iterator class to support generic container traversal.

Key Concepts

Class templates

Dynamic arrays

Iterator implementation

Operator overloading

Encapsulation

📌 Project 2: Doubly-Linked List Container (STL Interface)

Educational Objectives

Understand generic programming and information hiding

Learn to design STL-compatible container interfaces

Practice using nested iterator classes and namespaces

Description
Developed a templated doubly-linked list with an interface and iterator behavior consistent with the C++ STL. The project emphasizes modular design and abstraction.

Key Concepts

Doubly-linked lists

STL-style container design

Nested classes (iterators)

Namespaces

Operator overloading

📌 Project 3: Binary Tree and Its Application (ABET Assessment Project)

Educational Objectives

Gain experience with binary trees

Apply recursive algorithms

Demonstrate fundamental programming competence

Description
Implemented a binary expression tree to convert mathematical expressions from postfix notation to infix notation. This project serves as the course’s ABET assessment, demonstrating mastery of core programming concepts.

Key Concepts

Binary trees

Tree traversal

Recursion

Expression parsing

Memory management

📌 Project 4: Hash Tables and Its Applications

Educational Objectives

Understand the hash table data structure

Learn collision handling and hashing strategies

Apply data structures to real-world problems

Description
Implemented a hash table ADT and used it to build a simple password server system for managing user accounts.

Key Concepts

Hash functions

Collision resolution

Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

User authentication logic

Performance considerations
